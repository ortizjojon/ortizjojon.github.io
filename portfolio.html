        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> A simple Turn Based RPG Game(Boss Fight), where the user plays as a Knight fighting against
        a dark cult leader,"The Goat",to stop the crimson moon from destroying the world. For every attack you make on the Boss,
        you are scored points. All of the decisions made by the enemy are random, 
        having 4 options.(Attack,Raise Attack,Lower Attack,Heal) Randomness can also occur from how much damage you deal and take.
        When the boss's health reaches at a certain point, he summons an entity called "The Book" granting him higher attack power and
        a higher chance of attacking the user.This ups the difficulty and is where most people lose, myself included. The user loses when their
        health reaches 0, showing a game over screen which plays an 8-Bit version of Soundgarden's "Black Hole Sun".</p>
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>I created the game out of love for some Turn Based RPGs.The direction I was heading the game towards was more of a dark theme with
        minor references to roguelike medias. Two main successful points in the developement process were getting the general playstyle in first before I got into
        making the sprites and designs. Another would also be giving the game it's retro feel, using third party programs to create sprites for the game
        and throwing in 8-Bit versions of Rock songs polished the game. I did however come across some issues with the program itself, such as having 
        some animations not correspond with thier proper role, recieving extra turns after certain actions and even having the game being utterly IMPOSSIBLE to beat.
        These challenges took a while to overcome, but with more time, variables, math corrections and runthroughs, I now have a complete game. With the game
        being finished and all, if I the time and resources I think I would add a full party for the user to use, a team of four instead of just one hero. It would've made for
        more variety and unique decision making for the player. I'd also consider for myself to add more of a rewarding experience for beating the game, apart from a Congrats. </p>

        <p>The Algorithm above contributes significantly above to the game's main play style. It dictates the enemy's decision making and broadcasts different choices.
        After the enemy's turn is finished, it switchs to the players turn and the enemy waits until an option is completed.</p>

        <p>Every block corresponds to the actions made by the enemy. Variables are then changed from that action.</p>
